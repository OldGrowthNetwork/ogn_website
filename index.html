                    <p>Old Growth Network aims to halt the deforestation of the oldest forest in British Columbia. We are a a network of concerned citizens, scientists, biologists and activists who support the legal action launched by Friends of Fairy Creek Society to protect migratory birds and the trees they nest in!
                    We call on you to help us to preserve endangered species, Old Growth Trees and our planet.</p>

                    <p>We believe it's our legal obligation to inform, educate and network to ensure the public knows what we can do to stop the demise of the migratory birds and stop the logging while we wait for the court case.</p>

                 <p>The marbled murrelet is a small seabird of the North Pacific that nests in Old Growth Forests. Decades of research have shown that they have very specific requirements for nesting trees: the trees must be high to allow them to make stall landings (swoop up and stall as they land); gaps in the forest to allow them to access canopy boughs; and moss-covered branches and wide limbs on which to nest. They don't make a nest, but lay a single egg in a hollow in the mossy platform. These specific requirements for nesting are generally only provided in old-growth conifers within 30 km of the ocean.Consequently over 95% of nests have been found in old growth forests across their range. </p>
 
<p>Migratory birds and their nests are protected by legislation in Canada and an international convention with the USA, Mexico, Japan and Russia. We argue that the government has not done enough to enforce these protections. This is why Friends of Fairy Creek Society have filed a petition to compel enforcement.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Marbled Murrelet is important to both marine and forest ecosystems. By holding the Canadian government accountable Friends of Fairy Creek Society will halt the destruction of the birds’ nests and the forest as a whole.</strong></p>

                    <p>A Court will be asked to examine and determine whether the destruction of old growth endangers the Marbled Murrelet in contravention of the law. Since Canada and BC have a duty to uphold the law, it is an effort to press governments to meet their obligations and take effective measures to protect endangered migratory birds.</p></div>
