                    <p>Old Growth Network aims to halt the deforestation of the oldest forest in British Columbia. We are a community of environmentalists, activitsts, biologists and ecologosists who support the legal action launched by Friends of Fairy Creek Society to protect migratory birds and the trees they nest in!
                    We call on you to help us to preserve endangered species, Old Growth Trees and our planet.</p> 

                    <p>Migratory birds and their nests are protected by legislation in Canada and an international convention with the USA, Mexico, Japan and Russia. We argue that the government has not done enough to enforce these protections. This is why Friends of Fairy Creek Society have filed a petition to compel enforcement.</p>

                    <p>The Marbled Murrelet is important to both marine and forest ecosystems. By holding the Canadian government accountable Friends of Fairy Creek Society will halt the destruction of the birds’ nests and the forest as a whole.</p>

                    <p>Your donation counts! We invite you to make whatever monetary contribution you can to support the petition. We are a network of supporters as the case progresses. Friends of Fairy Creek Society is a non-profit incorporated Society and are not able to provide tax receipts.</p>

                    <p>The marbled murrelet is a small seabird of the North Pacific that nests in Old Growth Forests. The Marbled Murrelets do not build nests, they are unique in nesting in the canopies of large trees. Decades of research have shown that they have very specific requirements for nesting trees: the trees must be high to allow them to make stall landings (swoop up and stall as they land); gaps in the forest to allow them to access canopy boughs; and moss-covered branches and wide limbs on which to nest. They don't make a nest, but lay a single egg in a hollow in the mossy platform. </p><p><strong>These specific requirements for nesting are generally only provided in old-growth conifers within 30 km of the ocean.</strong> Consequently over 95% of nests have been found in old growth forests across their range. They return to the same area annually to nest and rear their young. They can travel over a hundred kilometers a day between their inland nest sites and marine foraging areas, where they hunt for small fish to feed their chicks. Murrelets are unusual among seabirds in their solitary and secretive nesting habits. They avoid predators by flying silently at high speeds (greater than 80 km/h) during twilight to visit their secluded forest nests.

                    <p>Migratory birds have been protected since 1919. The Marbled Murrelet is important to both marine and forest ecosystems. By holding the Canadian government accountable we will halt the destruction of the birds’ nests and thereby the forest as a whole.</p>

                    <p>A Court will be asked to examine and determine whether the destruction of old growth endangers the Marbled Murrelet in contravention of the law. Since Canada and BC have a duty to uphold the law, it is an effort to press governments to meet their obligations and take effective measures to protect endangered migratory birds.</p></div>
